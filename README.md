# Dynamic Web TWAIN integrating with Vue.js 3

## Overview

Currently, there is no difference of integrating Dynamic Web TWAIN with Vue.js 3.0. Considered that Vue.js 3.0 is still a preview version, it is recommended to use Vue.js 2 in your production. Though Dynamic Web TWAIN is ready for Vue.js 3, other libraries, such as UI libraries, are still adapting to the new version.
